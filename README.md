# reverse-sudoku
This project explores applying the "wave function collapse" concept to solve Sudoku puzzles.

Here (index.html) https://brianbjc.github.io/reverse-zudoku/ , users can view the potential state of a Sudoku grid. As users click on numbers, those numbers collapse into a chosen state and influence the behavior of adjacent cells according to Sudoku rules. 

Clicking on cells with the least entropy is crucial to prevent the algorithm from collapsing prematurely.

Below are some functions that proved essential in programming this experiment. I hope they provide value to others exploring similar projects.
