# reverse-sudoku
This project explores applying the "wave function collapse" concept to solve Sudoku puzzles.

Here (index.html) https://brianbjc.github.io/reverse-zudoku/ , users can view the potential state of a Sudoku grid. As users click on numbers, those numbers collapse into a chosen state and influence the behavior of adjacent cells according to Sudoku rules. 

Clicking on cells with the least entropy is crucial to prevent the algorithm from collapsing prematurely.

Here are some images I generated while conceptualizing the algorithm. I hope you find them useful.

Thank you very much.
